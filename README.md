# Fun_Riddle

My little brother had a book of riddles for smart kids that included this little gem: 
Using the each of the digits 0-9 only once create two fractions that when added together equal 1. 

I had just finished my first semester of Java and I decided to use my computer to solve this riddle. 

Try it out yourself first before you look at my code. 

I have since upgraded my code so it is more efficient. This is what is found in the Riddle2.java file.
