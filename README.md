# Fun_Riddle

# My little brother had a book of riddles for smart kids that included this little gem: 
# Using the each of the digits 0-9 only once create two fractions that when added together equal 1. 

# I had just finished my first semester of Java and I decided to use my computer to solve this riddle. 

# Try it out yourself first before you look at my code.
